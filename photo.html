                    Lugging all this gear around the US is totally worth it when images like these are the final result :)
                    <br><br>
                    Of all the images I took in this summer stretch, this one I think is my favorite. The colors are balanced, the gaseous
                    nebula is clearly visible with great definition. I espescially like the bottom of the image, where the South American
                    nations would be if this was truly North America. The red with dark clouds of black contrast nicely, and really makes
                    the image pop.

                    An emission nebula located in the Cygnus constellation. This wider angle image allows you to see some of the surrounding
                    nebulosity, as well as some of the North American nebula (towards the top).
                    <br><br>
                    For this image, I spent time getting the guide scope calibrated so I could actually use it. This smaller scope which
                    sits on top of the main optical tube helps keep the mount tracking correctly by sending small pulses to the main mount
                    to correct for any slight drift as it takes each long exposure.

                    A photo that survived getting drenched by sprinklers the morning after. Around 3 hours of data for this guy. Hopefully
                    the first of a summer series of nebula captures.
                    <br><br>
                    Named after the dark region at the bottom of the nebula, it also resembles the pillars of creation (imo), which is
                    something I hope to one day be able to capture

                    Spring time is known as Galaxy season because many galaxies are out and about in the night sky. M81,
                    also known as Bode’s Galaxy, is the larger of these two galaxies, located on the right in this
                    image. The Cigar Galaxy is the smudge of a neighbor to the left. This pair of galaxies are both over
                    11 million light years away.

                    First time the new EQR6 mount came with many difficulties and learning moments, but I am happy with
                    this result (and honestly just being able to get time to shoot with cooperating weather).

                    Finally got to use my new dedicated astrophotography camera and decided to reshoot the Orion Nebula.
                    Was pleasantly
                    surprised the way this one turned out, I captured a lot more of the nebulosity in both the Orion
                    Nebula and the
                    Running Man Nebula (formation seen at the top).
                    <br><br>
                    Last weekend my Meade LX85 mount went caput, so I had to use an older LX65 mount which tracks alt/az
                    instead of
                    equatorial. My portable battery also died after 26 minutes of imaging, so this was all that I could
                    capture. Baby steps
                    still… but progress nonetheless!

                <h2>Lunar Eclipse</h2>
                <p class="subtext"><span style="font-style:normal;">&#128197; </span>November 20th, 2021</p>
                <p class="subtext"><span style="font-style:normal;">&#128205; </span>Lake Brownwood State Park, TX</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    What happens when the sun, earth and moon all line up? An eclipse, and in this case, a lunar one. The earths shadow is
                    being cast onto the moon, and over the course of a few hours a very bright white full moon turns silver, then gray, then
                    a dark red color.
                    <br><br>
                    Why the red color you ask? This happens because of a phenomenon called “Rayleigh scattering”, where different
                    wavelengths of light are refracted in different ways. In this case the red wavelength (longer) light is scattered less,
                    and therefore we see it reflected back to us on the surface of the moon during an eclipse.
                    <br><br>
                    This single 1second exposure shows maximum coverage of this particular lunar eclipse. The white sliver on the left is
                    the tiny percentage of the moon that wasn’t covered by earths shadow.

                    My first ever deep sky object, and one of my personal favorites, the Great Orion Nebula.
                    <br><br>
                    This nebula is about 1300 light years away, meaning the light captured in this image is 1300 years old. To equate that
                    to our earthly timeline, this light seen here was forming sometime in the 7th century, the beginning of the Dark Ages in
                    Europe…

                    I took this photo with my Lumix DSLR rubber-banded to my telescope. A single frame, but clear enough to see details on
                    the moon. Taken from bortle class 3 in a New Mexico State park, before the clouds rolled in.
